# ID.me Login Page Clone - Academic Demo Project

## 🎓 Academic Purpose
This project is a **UI clone of the ID.me login page** created for educational purposes as part of a final year project. It demonstrates modern web development practices, security implementations, and data handling.

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice
- **This is for educational demonstration only**
- **Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt** - never stored in plaintext
- Implements proper security practices for academic learning
- Should never be used for actual authentication systems

## 🚀 Live Demo
- **Main Application**: https://same-07g5izupand-latest.netlify.app
- **Admin Panel**: https://same-07g5izupand-latest.netlify.app/admin

## 📋 Features Demonstrated

### 1. UI/UX Cloning
- ✅ Pixel-perfect replica of ID.me login interface
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices
- ✅ Interactive form elements with validation
- ✅ Professional styling and layout

### 2. Form Data Capture
- ✅ Real-time form submission handling
- ✅ Email and password field validation
- ✅ "Remember me" functionality
- ✅ Success/error message handling

### 3. Security Implementation
- ✅ **Password hashing with bcrypt** (industry standard)
- ✅ Secure data storage with SQLite
- ✅ Admin authentication system
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### 4. Data Management
- ✅ Admin dashboard to view captured data
- ✅ Export functionality for data analysis
- ✅ Metadata collection (IP, user agent, timestamp)
- ✅ Statistics and analytics view

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: SQLite with proper schema
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## 📊 Admin Panel Access
1. Visit: `/admin`
2. Use admin key: `demo-admin-key`
3. View all captured login attempts
4. Export data as JSON
5. Verify password hashes

## 🔐 Security Features Demonstrated

### Password Security
```javascript
// Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
```

### Data Storage Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE login_attempts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Securely hashed
  remember_me BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
